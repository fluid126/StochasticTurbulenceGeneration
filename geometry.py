"""Some elaboration on the coordinate system may be useful. A grid
point with zero based index (ix,iy,iz) is located at the physical
coordinate (ix/Lx,iy/Ly,iz/Lz). This is consistent with (Lx,Ly,Lz)-
periodicity.

Due to periodicity, there is no physically well defined center. However,
in the indexing sense, the most reasonable horizontal center is (N-1)/2.

Below is an illustration with Lx=Nx=7 and Ly=Ny=4. The indexing centrum
is marked with 'C' and grid points with 'o'.
